Features
========

KSThreadProxy provides a few convenient means of executing code on a different thread to the current one, both for pre and post-block worlds.

To send a message to an object on a different thread:

    [[object ks_proxyOnThread:thread] doThing];

Note that you can pass nil to automatically target the main thread. The call is blocking so that you even receive the return value back properly. Alternatively, `ks_proxyOnThread:waitUntilDone:` is available to explicitly do the work asynchronously.

`dispatch_sync` has one annoyance: it deadlocks when used by a serial queue to target itself. KSThreadProxy adds a handful of convenience methods for bouncing blocks over to specific threads, in a non-deadlocking fashion, such as `-[NSThread ks_performBlockAndWait:]`

I'm Mike Abdullah, of [Karelia Software](http://karelia.com). [@mikeabdullah](http://twitter.com/mikeabdullah) on Twitter.

Questions about the code should be left as issues at https://github.com/karelia/KSThreadProxy or message me on Twitter.

Dependencies
============

None beyond Foundation. Works back to OS X v10.5 for the actual thread proxy. Compiler support for blocks is required for methods that use them, which in practice means OS X v10.6.
